Here is lies the rough draft

# IT Infrastructure for Prototyping and Entreprenuership

**Goal:** The focus of this book in to address a repeated need that I have
witnessed working in a university that is striving to produce startups and
innovation.  In my opinion the underlying issue is setting up **IT
scaffolding** and
**reproducability.**  These problems come about two fold.  You have the nature of the university that the student body is always changing and moving on.  There is wisdom in having the next generation reproduce everything to learn the basics, that I won't argue.  But if you goal is to move the research further and into new and innovative areas, then starting from sratch is not always desirous.  In fact depending on the skill sets of the particialar years worth of students, you may move backwards having to start again.    Reproducability is the ability to quickly deploy or redeploy your code using version control (Git and Github) and IT infrastructure at the push of a button; on your laptop to demo at a conference, to investors, or even colleagues--as well as with the push of a button deploy to Public Cloud (Amazone, Microsoft, Google) or internal private cloud (Such as Openstack or HPE Eucalyptus) or even private Platform as a Service such as Redhat OpenShift.

## Conclusion

This book is not a replacement for a knowledgeable IT administrator but gives you the researcher and innovator the tools you need to excel in your area and maintain that excellence.


## Outline:
    1. Picking the right specs...<br />
        a. CPU memory<br />
        b. Ram - Need to know how much traffic?<br />
        c. Storage<br />
    2. Picking the Base installation<br />
        a. OS - Ubuntu, Debian, Windows, etc...<br />
    3. Hosting Applications<br />
        a. Apache, NginX, Lighthttpd, Etc...<br />
    4. Storage/ Database<br />
        a. MySQL, NoSQL...<br />
        b. Handleing larger files and content<br />
    5. Installing all chosen Software (This could be a lab, or a detailed chapter that we pick the specs. and show a step by step installation)<br />
    6. Configuration of software<br />
    7. Security<br />
        a. SSL- Let's Encrypt, GoDaddy (Paid vs Free SSL)<br />
        b. Blocking not need ports<br />
        c. Handleing traffic<br />
    **(Scalability)<br />
    8. Going with a load balancer with multi back end server...<br />

    ## Lab Idea's<br />
    1. <br />
        LOW: Research and list a computer parts that can host a webserver and have an a traffic load of 10 users at once. <br />
        High: Research and list a computer parts that can host a webserver and have an a traffic load of 100 users at once with a certain budget.<br />
        Tehnical Skill: Install the needed software for the rest of the labs. "Vagrant, Virtualbox..." <br />
    2. <br />
        LOW: Find 10 OS that are used everyday and list if they are open sourced or not <br />
        High: Find 4 OS that are not used everyday (not too famous) and list the reason behind why you picked them? <br />
        Techincal Skill: Install (#) of OS on a virtual platform (Virtualbox, Vmware, Parallel, Etc...) "Try with Vagrant"<br />
    3. <br />
        Low: List advantages and Dis advantages of 3 Webservers of your choice. <br />
        High: <br />
        Technical Skill: Install 3-5 different webservers on different OS
