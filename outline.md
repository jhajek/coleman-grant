Here is lies the rough draft

# IT Infrastructure for Prototyping and Entreprenuership

**Goal:** The focus of this book in to address a repeated need that I have
witnessed working in a university that is striving to produce startups and
innovation.  In my opinion the underlying issue is setting up **IT
scaffolding** and
**reproducability.**  These problems come about two fold.  You have the nature of the university that the student body is always changing and moving on.  There is wisdom in having the next generation reproduce everything to learn the basics, that I won't argue.  But if you goal is to move the research further and into new and innovative areas, then starting from sratch is not always desirous.  In fact depending on the skill sets of the particialar years worth of students, you may move backwards having to start again.    Reproducability is the ability to quickly deploy or redeploy your code using version control (Git and Github) and IT infrastructure at the push of a button; on your laptop to demo at a conference, to investors, or even colleagues--as well as with the push of a button deploy to Public Cloud (Amazone, Microsoft, Google) or internal private cloud (Such as Openstack or HPE Eucalyptus) or even private Platform as a Service such as Redhat OpenShift.

This book is not a replacement for a knowledgeable IT administrator but gives you the researcher and innovator the tools you need to excel in your area and maintain that excellence.
